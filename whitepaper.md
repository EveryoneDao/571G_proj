## Features
1.	The resources, including the power to organize an event and vote an event, are shared among community.
2.	The decision of proposed events is made by everyone in the community.
3.	The accountability of voting results lies in every individual in the community.

## Basic Functions
### Organizer contract
-	Create a voting event
-	Spread the tokens generated in voting event to addresses 

### Ballot contract (ERC 20?)
-	signalling proposal/ on-chain proposal
-	real time results/ encrypted results 
-	Delegation functions 
-	number of tokens generated = number of participants
-	% xx support to pass the proposal 
-	Last time to end the voting 
-	Proposal type: a concrete proposal, such as savingüê∞ or protect üå≤; or proposals on directions of changing the dao/dapp

## Additional Functions
-	Reward mechanism 
-	Challenge the event procedure (approaches in voting, such as existing time, real-time/ blind voting, voting participants)
-	Challenge the event results (appeal)
